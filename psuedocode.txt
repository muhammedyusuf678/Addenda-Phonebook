always start with pseudo code
before creating a contact -- see if a document for this contact exists by checking email, get the id and put it into users array


to get list of all users who have a contact: 

go through each user and check if their contacts array has that contact documents reference

the in progress and completed status can be interprocess / interthread communication.
create a pool of workers to which you just send messages from main

/////////
Main thread will add temp contact to temp contact collection and send a message to workers in round robin fashion

Workers pool will be continuously listening for temp contacts and will pick up an in progress one and process it
I will need to pass to the worker for which user I am adding second contacts
Also no duplicate second contacts
